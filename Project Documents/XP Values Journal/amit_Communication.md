In Week #1, We walked through the project requirements and each one was given a task to explore diffrent games. So each of us descibed his approach to the game and explained his idea. So we shared our idea clearly with each other.

In week #2, After finalizing the game, we had to decide on esign patterns for different features of the game. So, we came up with 6 design patterns and finally agreed upon 4 to work on. Thes best part was division of work. The team members expressed there interest in the particular feature and design pattern by themselves. Again making the communication very clear and task assignment was done accordingly.

In week #3, Once the game was in last week there were individual features which were added to the game by each member. So the integration played a vital role. During this integration phase, each one of us displayed his/her feature and explained his dependency on another feature if any. This reduced our code integration time by 20%.
