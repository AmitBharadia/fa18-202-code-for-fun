## Week 1 :

Initially we were searching for the right game so that we could leverage the use of Design patterns to its full potential. Each of us icked up a few games and then we exchanged the selected games between each of us to give the feedback and understand other point of view in chosing that particular game.

## Week 2 :

During this week there was constant feedback regarding choosing the deign patterna and how well could each design pattern fit in the problem scope. We then started changing the code according to the selected design patterns and again started reviewing the code.

## Week 3 :

As this being our final week to implement and submit the whole functionality, we decided to go through each others code, as a peer review and see if the implementation of the design pattern was right. We also exchanged our ideas regarding each others code quality and coding standards.
